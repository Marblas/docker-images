# Docker-images

Repository contains collections of files (including `Dockerfile` ) for building Docker images for various tools.

Each directory corresponds to one automatically builded and published Docker image. To download the image, do the following:

```bash
docker pull docker-registry.siecobywatelska.pl/{directory}:latest
```

The appropriate tags are used for each branch. The `latest` tag is used for the `master` branch.
